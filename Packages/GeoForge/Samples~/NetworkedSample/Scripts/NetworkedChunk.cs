    /// This script is intended to give users a robust example of how they might structure terrain chunks using the
    /// Marching Cubes API as well as the PurrNet framework. The script leverages PurrNet's lifecycles, network identity
    /// callbacks, NetworkModules, and the visibility system to handle ownership tracking, exchange, and handoffs to allow users
    /// to seamlessly swap between server authoritative and local terraforming based on client proximity. This capability
    /// creates lag-free environment regardless of host ping and location.
    ///
    /// Edit application hook: GeoChunk's own constructor subscribes PassVoxelEdits to
    /// IGeoEditStore.OnGeoEditChanged automatically, every time a GeoChunk is constructed - that
    /// is the single, canonical path from "the store's data changed" to "the octree gets
    /// revalidated." Do not add a second subscription for this (e.g. in OnSpawned) - a previous
    /// version of this sample did exactly that via ApplyEditsToBaseChunk, which duplicated
    /// PassVoxelEdits's own logic and ran a full unpack/release cycle a second time for every
    /// edit batch, for no effect beyond wasted work.
